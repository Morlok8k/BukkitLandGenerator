Bukkit Land Generator
---------------------
Version 0.1.0 Alpha (Preview Release)
---------------------



This, "BLG", is plugin for the Minecraft Server mod, Bukkit.

This was created as Minecraft Land Generator cannot generate worlds that are plugin-based - that is, Worlds that are not available in Vanilla (Unmodified) Minecraft.
This is actually an Issue with Bukkit, and not MLG...  Worlds created via Plugins do not behave the same way as the originals do - at least not in the way that MLG exploits the server.

I created this plugin to be able to expand my plugin based worlds that MLG couldn't access.


It tells the server to generate chunks of land by force without actually visiting that location.

It doesn't matter what type of map it is: normal, nether, skylands, some random plugin...  It all generates correctly!


INSTRUCTIONS:
 - Installation:
     - Just install like all other bukkit plugins:
     - Put BukkitLandGenerator.jar in the Plugins folder
     - Start/Restart/Reload the bukkit server.

 - Generating:
     - While playing Minecraft on this Bukkit Server:
     - access the chat interface (usually just by hitting the key "t")
     - type:
             /BLGgen x
     - where "x" is the number of chunks you want in a square diamater.
         - Yes, BLG uses chunks, and MLG uses blocks.  There are 16 Blocks in a Chunk.
         - No, case doesn't matter.  you can type "/blggen 10" if you want to.


Version History:

0.1.0 Alpha (Preview Release)
 - First Release
 - Many Bugs (Overloading and crashing of the server - this has some workarounds for most of the bugs)
 - Has hard-coded limits on the size it can create at one time, to prevent server crashing.
 - Intentionally generates Chunks MUCH SLOWER than Minecraft Land Generator:
    - Two reasons for this:
    - 1. I'm trying to prevent the overloading of the server - it's very easy to do this!
       - My very first working version of BLG actually ran faster than MLG, but kicked all users while generating.
    - 2. Unlike MLG, where you may have downtime while expanding the world, BLG is running on a running server which may have multiple people playing on, so it doesn't matter as much if it takes a bit longer generating land.
